Practicals Performed

Basic Linux Commands: Practiced essential Linux commands (ls, cd, pwd, etc.) to navigate the file system and manage files and directories effectively.

Writing C Code in Linux: Used the vi editor to write and compile C programs directly within the Linux terminal.

Foreground and Background Processes: Explored how processes run in the foreground and background using shell commands.

fork() Function: Implemented the fork() system call to create child processes and observe process IDs and execution flows.

FCFS Scheduling Algorithm: Developed a program for the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm using gantt chart to study basic non-preemptive scheduling.

SJF Scheduling Algorithm: Implemented the Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm using gantt chart to minimize average waiting time and turnaround time.

Priority Preemptive Scheduling: Wrote a program for Priority Scheduling with preemption using gantt chart to handle process execution based on dynamic priority values.

Banker's Algorithm: Implemented the Banker's Algorithm to simulate deadlock avoidance through safe state checks during resource allocation.

Shell Commands and Shell Scripting: Implemented basic shell commands and scripts.

If-Else and Elif Conditions in Shell Scripts: Created decision-based shell scripts using if, else, and elif for branching logic.
